🔐 Modeling and Predicting Cyber Hacking Breaches
📖 Overview
Cyber hacking breaches pose a serious threat to organizations by causing financial loss, data theft, and reputational damage. Traditional manual analysis methods are often slow and ineffective.
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to model, analyze, and predict potential cyber hacking breaches based on historical data.
By identifying patterns and risk factors from past incidents, the system helps in predicting future breaches and supports proactive cybersecurity planning.

🌟 Features
Data Preprocessing
Handles missing values, performs normalization, and applies encoding techniques to prepare the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzes attack trends, frequency, impact, and time-based patterns in cyber breaches.
Machine Learning Models
Implements algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for breach prediction.
Breach Risk Prediction
Predicts whether an organization is at high risk or low risk of experiencing a cyber attack.
Performance Evaluation
Evaluates model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
